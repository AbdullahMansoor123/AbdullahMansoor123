### 👋 Hi, I'm Abdullah

🚀 **MLOps Engineer** | Automating ML Workflows | Building Scalable, Production-Ready Systems

Welcome to my GitHub! I specialize in bridging the gap between machine learning models and real-world applications by building robust, scalable, and automated ML infrastructure. My key focus areas include:

* **End-to-End MLOps**: Model training, deployment, monitoring, and CI/CD.
* **Cloud & Automation**: AWS, GitHub Actions, and infrastructure as code.
* **Data Engineering**: Scalable pipelines for cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation.
* **Infrastructure**: Containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and serverless architectures.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **ML/DL**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
* **Data**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **MLOps**: Docker, MLflow, FastAPI, Flask
* **Cloud**: AWS, GCP
* **Automation**: GitHub Actions, CI/CD

💡 Passionate about improving ML deployment workflows, observability, and cost efficiency.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring

* Generative AI | LangChain | Advanced CI/CD Strategies
